# RobotSimulation
 This project for an Operating Systems course used multithreading and resource management to simulate robots pushing blocks around with limited power

The assignment was to imagine that a set of robots can only move if they have access to a color of Ink. The ink is a resources that must be shared between all robots that are of that color. From a base line to create the GUI (written by the professor) we were able to simulate this problem with the help of multithreading and mutex locks at the critical sections to properly manage the resources between threads.
